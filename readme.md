## Design Notes
Building a 2D RPG Combat system in Unity


## Results of Course Videos
### Section 1 - Introduction & Setup
- Part 1 - 5: These are the introduction to the course and system set up instructions that are common in all the course.  They are using Unity Editor 22.2f1.  My version is 22.1f1.  I am hoping that is close enough that I will not run into issues following the course.  I can update that at a later time if necessary.  Not much else to show for the course in this sections.  I've been using VS Code for years now and already had the necessary extensions from another Unity course I have started.
### Section 2 - Player Movement
- Part 1: The Introduction   
This part was a quick overview of what will be coming through the rest of this section.  No development happens here
- Part 2: Player Input System  
We created a simple sprite (triange) and put it into the middle of our camera view.  Next we incorporated the Unity 2D movement system and linked everything together so we can move the sprite around.  I did the File -> Build and Run and was able to play the game.  Had to close it using Task Manager as there was no exit path built into the game yet.

- Part 3: Import Player Sprites  
The player sprites reels were imported and split into segments.  We then replaced the triange with the first image of the idle player
